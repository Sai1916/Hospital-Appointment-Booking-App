# Hospital Appointment Booking App using React-Native

<p>
 This is an Hospital Appointment Booking App. Purpose of this app was we don't need to go for the hospital to book appointment or no need to call hospital to book appointment, through this we can directly book the appointment by watching the reviews and ratings of the hospital and doctor as well.
</p>

<p>To build this app I have used Expo to develop the React-Native application.</p>
